## Background

~Product Manager everywhere

* Microsoft: VS for Databases (new product, as opposed managing an existing product)
* anywhere.fm: 2007, own startup, upload music to the cloud and listen to it from anywhere
* connected: 2010, own startup, simplify contact management
* LinkedIn: acquired connected. worked on contact management and updates (2011), sales navigator (2013)

# What is Product Management?

## What do Product Managers do?

Product Managers drive the
* vision
* strategy
* design, and
* execution
of their product.

Product managers drive, but not own (because they don't actually do the work themselves). Most managerial roles involve some elements of the responsibilities listed above, but the fact that product managers drive, but don't own the initiatives, is a key differentiator.

## Vision [~14:00m]


### Coming up with a vision

A compelling vision articulates how the world would be a better place if you succeed.

A template: customer-centric vision narrative

Lack of clear thinking sometimes hides behind bullet points in presentations. Forcing someone to articulate vision (with a narrative) can ensure clear thinking.

Jeff Bezos asks everyone in Amazon to write six pages of customer-centric narrative to support their proposals. Writing six-page narratives would be very hard without having clear thinking.

* Pre-launch employee memo from Stewart Butterfield - [Probably this one!](https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d#.sd3325sze)

Here are some examples of vision (mission statements)
* Uber: [Transportation as reliable as running water](https://newsroom.uber.com/australia/transportation-that-is-as-reliable-as-running-water/) ([and the TED talk by Travis Kalanick talking about Uber Pool](https://www.ted.com/talks/travis_kalanick_uber_s_plan_to_get_more_people_into_fewer_cars?language=en) - [the transcript](https://www.ted.com/talks/travis_kalanick_uber_s_plan_to_get_more_people_into_fewer_cars/transcript?language=en))

### Great examples

Elon Musk - "It is important that humanitary(?) become an inter-planetary species."

### Selling a vision

*It takes 7 impressions to garner a response from a marketing message.* (Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn)

You need to be constantly repeating your vision for the exact same reason.

Are you succeeding at it? Ask a team-member what the product is about and where it is going and see how many times they repeat your vision using your words.


## Strategy

### Coming up with a strategy

A compelling strategy articulates in detail exactly how you are going to dominate your market.

A vision should be stable, but your strategy need to be **iterated on** and **refined** until you find product-market fit.

Ditch the business plan; instead focus on a few-page summary that captures each of your critical **product-market fit hypotheses**.

#### Types of product-market fit hypotheses

* Target audience [~23:00m]
    - Who is your ideal customer who is going to love your product?
        * Not the VC-pitchdeck version
        * Presents a nice example with LinkedIn
* Problem you are solving
    - It's important to articulate the problem independent of the solution
    - Is it nice to have or need to have? (vitamins vs pain-killers)
    - You want to get to a point where it's need-to-have
* Value propositions
    - What is the value you are promising to deliver?
* Strategic Differentiation
    - Why is your product better than anything else that exists in the industry?
    - You should be striving for 10x improvement
    - Incremental improvements are not good enough, because it may not be enough to offset the cost of switching [~25:40m]
* Competition
    - How does your product compare to direct competitors (in existing markets) or indirect competitors (in new markets)?
        * How were they doing it?
        * How does your product improve upon it?
* Acquisition strategy
    - If you build it, they will not come.
    - How do you find and attract your best customers?
    - How are you going to do it cost-effectively?
* Monetization Strategy
    - What's the willingness of the customer to pay? How much can they pay?
* KPIs
    - Define up-front
        * your KPIs, and
        * what they are going to look like in case of success.

Advice: minimize your dimensions of innovation. Don't try to innovate on all 8 dimensions listed above. Choose only a few dimensions to innovate on, and leverage best practices everywhere else.

Innovating ~ Taking risks


### Great examples

#### Google Maps vs MapQuest [~29:30m]

They just innovated on superior technology.

#### Tesla

* Top-down approach to target audience (widening the base starting with the most luxurient segment)
* Strategic differentiation on performance (batteries)

#### Jeff Bezos

*Your gross margin is my opportunity.*


## Design

### Coming up with a design

A compelling design delivers a useful, usable and delightful experience to your customers.

* Designing *useful* and *usable* things is well understood
    - Customer research
    - Usability studies
* But how do you design something *delightful*?
    - Bring emotional intelligence to your product
        * owning and understanding the emotional state of your customer
        * What do they care about?
        * their psychological profile
    - Example: before iMac, PCs were these powerful machines that people loved but kept in office. iMac changed that, and gave people something that they loved to show off in their living room
        * Apple's ad line: Chic, not Geek
* How do you bring emotional intelligence to your product design?
    - Start by falling in love with the problem you are solving for your target customer (**but not with the soltuion**)
        * Understand them as individuals
        * What does they typical day look like?
        * What other services they are using?
    - Don't fall in love with your solution, because you'll keep iterating and changing them. If you are stuck to a given solution, it may not work.
    - Develop Personas
        * Personas are fictional characters developed to represent different archetypes of users of your product.
        * A persona typically describes (associated with the members of a particular segment)
            - goals
            - pain points
            - behaviors
            - psychology
            - sometimes a name, an image and a background story is attached to bring the persona to life
        * Personas go beyond customer segments and include psychological profile and character
        * Good example: Mailchimp has published all their personas - https://blog.mailchimp.com/new-mailchimp-user-persona-research/
* He made his entire R&D team sit and watch user interviews to help them empathize with the target audience [~37:18m]
* Jared M Spool, Founder, User Interface Engineering [~37:50m]
    - Mantra: Increase Exposure Hours
    - *It's the closest thing we've found to a silver bullet when it comes to reliably improving the design team's produce. The solution? Exposure hours. The number of hours each team member is exposed directly to users interacting with the team's design - or the team's competitor's design. There is a direct correlation between this exposure and the improvements we see in the designs that team produces.* (Fast Path to Great UX _ Increased Exposure Hours)
* Incorporating emotional delight into the design process [~38:30m]
    - Deliver delight by adding a **desired emotion** dimension to your product design process
    - Example: Jeff Weiner at LinkedIn emphasizes making his users feel accomplished
    - Example: Mailchimp does a great job of alleviating the anxiety before sending out of massmails with a well-designed review page that makes user feel he is confident/ready/in-control
    - Example: Attention to details can be delightful
        * (groupchat) Hipchat vs Slack: Slack has way more functionalities addressing every detail of team communication
        * But Slack is lucky because they use the product themselves day in day out
        * When you are not using the product yourself, it's very important to understand to make a conscious effort to understand how your users are going to use it
* How do you measure delight? [~40:00m]
    - NPS turns out to be a fairly close predictor, even though it was designed for something else - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter
    - At LinkedIn, they are heavy users of NPS to understand and measure user delight
* An example of high EQ experience: Instagram Filters
    - Instagram made your *mundane* photos *share-worthy* in seconds with beautiful photo filters

### Great examples

Steve Jobs - "It takes real hard work to have clean thinking, to build designs that are incredibly simple."



## Execution [~42:30m]

### Execution is important

* Relentless execution determines if your vision becomes a reality
* If you are not spending 60% of your time on execution, you are doing it wrong
* Execution is more important than vision, strategy and design - very important for Product Managers [~43:19m]

### What is execution?
* Product Management stuff, but also
* doing whatever it takes to win
* it's about having grit and being relentless
* at the same time, you need to be constantly calibrating
    - are you pointing the team in the right direction?
    - executing like crazy but without direction (strategy) is not very helpful

### Execution Loop

That's the challenge: constantly making progress but also learning from what you are doing. How do you do that?

* Core Execution Loop
    - Define: Define your hypothesis
    - Validate: Validate each hypothesis
    - Iterate: Iterate based on what you have learned
* This is bonedead simple, but when executing very fast, people often skip the *Validation* step. But you have to be validating whether the direction you are going in is the right one
* If you are tracking the loop formally, it becomes easier to measure and speed-up cycling through the loop, and that matters because that is fast (sped-up execution) and meaningful (because you are doing validation) progress

### Executing Execution Loop (Decision Making)

* Processes (like agile etc) help
* The real stumbling block is the way you make decisions in the team [~46:10m]
    - Decision making can be slow in large companies because there are many stakeholders
    - Decision making can be slow in small companies because people often join small companies/startups with the expectation that they have a voice and they will be heard
* Fred Kaufmann at LinkedIn introduced Decision Rights
    - **Fast Iteration** requires clear decision rights. *Who owns the decision?*
        * But no shortcut to building shared context
        * In practice quite complicated
        * In LinkedIn they used a framework called RAPID two determine
            - Who owns a decision?
            - Who influences a decision?
            - Who approves a decision?
        * A great solution comes when multiple stakeholders come together, but if you are doing it well, ultimately the decision will belong only to one decision maker or a small group of decision makers
    - If everyone understands the roles and processes, it can make execution faster and make people feel good
        * People know the process by which they are heard
        * They know the process by which their feedback gets bubbled up
        * When a decision is made, hopefully people are doing a good job of communicating the rationales
        * But no shortcut to building shared context
    - Designing the decision-making process is the responsibility of the Product Manager
        * Establish yourself as the **curator**, not the creator of great ideas
* Caveat: Favor decisions **today** over decisions **tomorrow**
    - The **enemy** of decision-making is **time**
    - Two types of decisions (Jeff Bezos in his letter to shareholders)
        * Irreversible decisions that have far-reaching implications for the company's future
            - These take a lot of work to get it right, and it's right to go slowly about them
        * Reversible decisions
            - We still need to think and plan
            - But we need to make these decisions fast
        * You need to be very clear about what type of decision you are making at every point and apply the right decision framework to it [~51:00m]
        * As your company grows, every decision may look like something that we need to spend a lot of time on understanding it, but most decisions are not that (Jeff Bezos)
            - AS CEO he needs to find a way to delegate down as far as possible to the actual owners of those problems in a way that makes sense
            - Corollary: after you have made a decision, when do you revisit it? Lateness Test
            - Lateness Test: Since the decision was made last, do we have any new information that we didn't have at the time of making the decision? [~51:50m]
                * If yes, then revisit the decision
                * Simply revisiting the decision makes no sense

### Executing Execution Loop (Engineering Velocity) [~52:30m]

Reward **engineering velocity** over **elegance**

* Instead of rewarding teams with elegant architectural solutions to yesterday's problems,
* Reward teams that are moving fast enough to solve today's customer challenges
* Engineers are motivated to build well-architected things to bring simplicity
    - that's a good idea, brings in goodness like code reuse and performance
    - but guess what, the customer may not need it any more, they need something else
* It's important to build a culture of rapid iteration and speed
    - Get the ideas in front of the user as quickly as possible
    - Invest when it's time to scale

### Invest in Retrospectives

Improve your ability to **accurately forecast** (and ultimately **improve**) engineering cost and product outcome estimates through post-sprint retrospectives

Only way to do it is to ask people constantly to make a prediction on how long something is going to take, and evaluate at the end of the cycle how we did, and that's going to help you improve your execution cadence.

### Metrics: Learn to Read the Matrix [~54:43m]

Build your intuition for metrics by spending time **every day** reviewing a few critical acquisition, engagement and monetization dashboards (from Jeff Weiner, CEO, LinkedIn)

This can often offer insights and be a key differentiator.

### Great examples

Stewart Butterfield (Slack) - "We do it really really fucking good."




# What does great Product Management looks like?


# Open QA [~57:10m]

1. How did you learn what you have learnt?
    * I had a great mentor
    * She emphasized the need to go talk to my team in the morning about something other than work (among other things)
    * Soft skills are very important
        - Great verbal/written communication
        - The ability to build rapport with anyone
        - The ability to inspire people
2. What did you learn from EIR (Trinity)? [~59:30m]

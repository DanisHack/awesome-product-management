# What is Product Management?

## What do Product Managers do?

Product Managers drive the
* vision
* strategy
* design, and
* execution
of their product.

Product managers drive, but not own (because they don't actually do the work themselves).

## Vision [~14:00m]


### Coming up with a vision

A compelling vision articulates how the world would be a better place if you succeed.

A template: customer-centric vision narrative

Lack of clear thinking sometimes hides behind bullet points in presentations. Forcing someone to articulate vision (with a narrative) can ensure clear thinking (Jeff Bezos does this in Amazon).
    * Example: Shareholder letters from Jeff Bezos
    * Example: Pre-launch employee memo from Stewart Butterfield

### Great examples

Elon Musk - "It is important that humanitary(?) become an inter-planetary species."

### Selling a vision

*It takes 7 impressions to garner a response from a marketing message.* (Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn)

You need to be constantly repeating your vision for the exact same reason.

Are you succeeding at it? Ask a team-member what the product is about and where it is going and see how many times they repeat your vision using your words.


## Strategy

### Coming up with a strategy

A compelling strategy articulates in detail exactly how you are going to dominate your market.

A vision should be stable, but your strategy need to be **iterated on** and **refined** until you find product-market fit.

Ditch the business plan; instead focus on a few-page summary that captures each of your critical **product-market fit hypotheses**.

#### Types of product-market fit hypotheses

* Target audience [~23:00m]
    - Who is your ideal customer who is going to love your product?
        * Not the VC-pitchdeck version
        * Presents a nice example with LinkedIn
* Problem you are solving
    - It's important to articulate the problem independent of the solution
    - Is it nice to have or need to have? (vitamins vs pain-killers)
    - You want to get to a point where it's need-to-have
* Value propositions
    - What is the value you are promising to deliver?
* Strategic Differentiation
    - Why is your product better than anything else that exists in the industry?
    - You should be striving for 10x improvement
    - Incremental improvements are not good enough, because it may not be enough to offset the cost of switching
* Competition
    - How does your product compare to direct competitors (in existing markets) or indirect competitors (in new markets)?
* Acquisition strategy
    - If you build it, they will not come.
    - How do you find and attract your best customers?
    - How are you going to do it cost-effectively?
* Monetization Strategy
    - What's the willingness of the customer to pay? How much can they pay?
* KPIs
    - Define up-front
        * your KPIs, and
        * what they are going to look like in case of success.

Advice: minimize your dimensions of innovation. Don't try to innovate on all 8 dimensions listed above. Choose only a few dimensions to innovate on, and leverage best practices everywhere else.

Innovating ~ Taking risks


### Great examples

#### Google Maps vs MapQuest [~29:30m]

They just innovated on superior technology.

#### Tesla

* Top-down approach to target audience (wideing the base starting with the most luxurient segment)
* Strategic differentiation on performance (batteries)

#### Jeff Bezos

*Your gross margin is my opportunity.*


## Design

### Coming up with a design

A compelling design delivers a useful, usable and delightful experience to your customers.

* Designing *useful* and *usable* things is well understood
    - Customer research
    - Usability studies
* But how do you design something *delightful*?
    - Bring emotional intelligence to your product

### Great examples

Steve Jobs - "It takes real hard work to have clean thinking, to build designs that are incredibly simple."






## Execution

### Great examples

Stewart Butterfield (Slack) - "??? Unreadable"

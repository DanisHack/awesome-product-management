# Official QA

1. Why did iGoogle get shut down? [~20:00m]
    * People were getting comfortable with having 7 tabs open for 7 different web pages simultaneously, reducing the need for one-page aggregation of iGoogle
        - Internet was getting faster
        - Browsers were getting faster
    * Changing old habits is hard. People didn't want all the little widget functionalities in one page.
2. Should one hire for one of the four PM-types (mentioned by Rose Yao) directly or should one hire generalists and nurture them according to their inclinations? [~ 22:20m]
    * Small teams/products
        - Just hire smart people who can handle what you throw at them (generalists)
        - May be a mix of juniors/seniors for more perspectives
            * for example, hire college grads for social products (their generation uses those products differently)
    * Maturing teams/products
        - Build the team by filling gaps
        - You may have biases towards on of the four PM-types, but a mix of different energies can be a good thing
3. Why is understanding the roles and responsibilities of a PM so difficult? [~24:25m]
    * For coder, designers, marketing professionals etc, their responsibilities are task-oriented and easy to define/comprehend.
    * PMs are essentially managers. They have to have intuition, actually be able to do things, and motivate people around them to do things. These are hard things to define.
    * Observation: when startups get acquired by companies, the CEOs usually end up taking product roles.
4. Is there any effort in Academia geared towards (training) PMs? [~25:50m]
    * Best way to be a product manager is to build stuff and see it through till the end (and learn from them mistakes)
    * Academic programs are probably not very relevant.
    * There are a few programs G/FB recruit APMs from
        - Curriculum includes building and shipping cross-functional, multi-discipline projects every semester
5. How is the APM program at Google? Should companies have one? [~27:30m]
    * PM skillsets for Enterprise and scrappy internet consumer companies are different. It makes sense to train people inhouse.
    * In its in-house APM training program, Google picks smart and well-performing techies to be trained for APM roles (sounds like no freshers without tech experience).
    * Google had "hundreds" of employees when the they rolled out the APM training program.
    * Uber and Intuit have similar programs.
6. For a PM role, how important is it to hire people one would enjoy working with? [~31:10m]
    * A PM has little power vested in his designation
        - No one reports to a PM
        - Everyone in the team is probably already super smart and already has ideas for the product (that they can implement themselves?)
    * A PMs power comes from his ability to persuade
        - The PM has to have their (his teammates) trust, and has to be someone they think can help them make their ideas happen
        - Enforcing an agenda/vision (messiah on the mountain top) is not a great way to be a PM. Listening to people (and not dismissing their ideas), building consensus and convincing people in important.
7. Facebook is a widely-used and addictive product, but its presence as a consumer brand is remarkably low (the logo has remained nearly identical for a decade). It doesn't seem to inspire passionate or polarising debates either. Is that by design? [~34:15m]
    * When your peers are nerd/geeks/highly technology-aware, products like Facebook may not seem to be fast-moving or appealing to them, but this perception seems to turn around once you move out of that bubble.
    * If you are a PM
        - Don't always build for yourself
      (This advice should probably be a little more nuanced. One should be building things differently at different stages (in the technology adoption curve) of the product. Question: Given that I think one should start by building for himself/herself, when should one stop building for oneself?)
        - Don't count on the opinion of your friends as the general consensus
    * Facebook tries to be utility. The focus is on the content from friends, and not the product itself.
8. How does doing one thing really well, as opposed to being well-rounded and feature-complete, fare as a product strategy?(example: Gmail 1.0 didn't even have folders/labels, but it had massive storage and liberated users from ever having to organize their mailbox for storage again) [~41:40m]
    * Particularly relevant in the mobile world, where real estate is small and competition for attention is hard
    * You should be able to explain the product in less than 30 seconds
    * For mass consumer products, do one thing really really well. Add bells and whistles you need to compete later.
    * Doing this is hard because we think about products in a nuanced way
9. How should one approach the competition? Founders tend to have a varied view. [~43:50m]
    * Two basic approaches
        - Let's not look at the competition because we are going to a novel place that they are not pursuing (no-follow)
        - Track competition religiously and fast-copy the good parts in their products
    * Do look at the competition, do know your market, don't put blinders on, but having that knowledge, you need to
        - figure out what you can do 10x better, and
        - are you in the right market?
    * Your product needs to do at least one thing really well (where users will find value and switch)
        - Every good idea that you see has probably been hashed over a dozen times before you see it
        - So if you limit yourself to only brand new things by principle, it would be very hard to build a company or product
        - At the same time, it is not good enough to do something better by 10% or 20% or even 50%. You have to be a game-changer. You have to be multiple orders of magnitudes better at some task or something of value in order to make people switch.
    * Google Desktop failed because being 20% faster at search compared to your OS was not good enough. (and then there was all that indexing headache)
10. How should one balance time and effort in innovation (orders-of-magnitude improvements, doing what no one else seems to be doing) and business-as-usual (taking care of feature-completeness, building incremental features) in products? [~47:00m]
    * There is no universally good answer to this.
    * A do-or-die scrappy small startup? Look ahead and innovate. Find the one thing you can do 10x better and focus on that.
    * A larger company with more mature product? Split your resources 50-50.
        - Start listening to your users
    * Innovation
        - Just listening to the users (interviews, focus-groups, surveys etc) is not enough
        - Should hire PMs who have a lot of intuition and opinion themselves about products they use (a good qn for interview: what would you build in 3 months vs 6 months vs a year? what kind of bets are you making?)
        - You probably can not get your 10x improvement idea from your users alone if you are not bringing any ideas to the table yourself
11. Where do the best ideas come from? [~49:50m]
    * They come from the team.
    * They come from people who work on the product 24/7 no matter their function
    * Sometimes they come from totally random side-projects

# Open QA

1. Often CEO is the PM originally and has to hire a PM at some point. How should the incoming PM handle the CEO's demotion? [~51:30m]
    * Letting go of the product can be a hard thing for the CEO. The CEO needs to be fully aware of the transition and accept it be ready for having a PM in the org, and the incoming PM should make sure of it.
    * The CEO should also be clear about why he needs a PM
        - Does he need someone to block and tackle for them? (the PM manages the day-to-day but the CEO sets the vision and direction)
        - Is the CEO ready to hire a more senior person and relinquish his control over setting the vision and direction as well?
        - What is the CEO willing to give up, and what he is not?
        - How is the CEO going to stop himself from jumping in, and who is going to hold him accountable for that?
    * Observation: CEOs tend to hire people who mirror them and believe in the product like they do. Once a PM demonstrates competence, CEOs tend to let go.
2. In a small startup where the CEO is also the PM and the developer team is small as well, should the product spec be detailed instruction or should it be about communicating vision? [~53:45m]
    * Products tend to change very fast these days
        - First iteration, for Rose Yao, is just one page
        - It covers
            * What they are trying to do
            * What success looks like
            * Her opinion on what the key features are
            * To some extent, the things they (the product) are not trying to do
            * May be a couple of wireframes
            * After the first round, iterating with mocks becomes an easier alternative
    * Try to avoid too many details in early product specs
3. How were the specs at FB? [~55:31m]
    * Feedback/suggestions from employees did not happen at spec level. Rather, feedback was taken from them by PMs through user interviews.
4. At G/FB, did you use any methodologies (SCRUM, AGILE etc) to run the product teams? [~57:10m]
    * The way teams were run roughly looked like AGILE, but no framework was ever followed rigorously or bureaucratically (filling up paperwork/digital forms at regular intervals)
    * It should be up to the individual teams to decide what works for them.
        - The PMs job is to find the best way to communicate with his team, so he/she has to be the adaptable one, working with coders who don't want to go to meetings and designers who don't want to whiteboard with other people
    * The only thing Rose Yao is religious about are
        - weekly team meetings
        - one-on-ones (a key component)
5. How do you work as a PM with a remote team? [~60:00m]
    * It's really hard, because face-to-face interaction is one of the useful leverages a PM has (being the person that the other person wants to work with)
    * Set high standards on meetings and interactions and follow up on slip ups (militantly!). People will follow the example you set up. If you say being late to a meeting is Ok, it becomes Ok.
    * Pay attention to personalities of your teammates to understand how to motivate them
    * Tricks from the books
        - free food
        - knowing about their friends
        - knowing about their significant other(s)
6. Old adage - you can have only two out of the three: on-time, well-done, within the price range. How do you make sure teams ship on-time?  [~62:50m]
    * Most projects don't ship on-time (especially in consumer products)
    * It's important not to get too militant about scheduling
    * If you do get militant about scheduling
        - engineers will think that you don't understand their jobs
        - designers will think that you don't care about quality
        - watch out for these as a PM
    * Build in slack-time right from the beginning
    * Ask hard questions and see if the product can be slimmed down
    * If teams are consistently missing milestones, keep them accountable
    * If you are missing milestones because
        - you don't know what the product is and keep going back to the draw board
            * then don't set deadlines before the R&D is complete
        - the product has too many features crammed into it
            * try to set small and quick (one or two weeks-long) milestones (more frequent course-correction can happen)
7. How would you go about providing contextual awareness and empathetic understanding of customers to your developers? [~65:45m]
    * Bring engineers/designers into user-research sessions or focus groups and make them watch people using the product and talking about it
        - Especially important if the target demographic for the product is different from the engineers'/designers'
8. Should one outsource user-research or focus-group studies or surveys under any circumstances? [~67:35m]
    * Early-stage products: do it in-house
    * Outsourcing surveys later on is sometimes alright
9. How do you do product roadmap? [~68:15m]
    * Rose Yao does product roadmaps for 3 to 6 months (detailed)
        - they can be specific
        - one be accountable
    * Product visions make sense at year-long stage (high level statements)
10. What 3 apps/tools can you not live without as a PM? [~70:10m]
    * Sketch for wireframing
    * Asana for task-tracking
    * Google Enterprise Suite (Email and Calendar)
11. Would you take a project that you are indifferent towards but which has an excellent team supporting it? [~71:35m]
    * Rose Yao probably would
        - Rose Yao's advice when picking teams: pick the people
        - Even if you are indifferent now, it may change later on, but with the right team
